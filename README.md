👋 Hi, I’m @mauriciodavalos
👀 I’m interested in web development, focusing on React and Node.js. I enjoy both frontend and backend development, and I'm always keen on improving user interfaces and creating seamless user experiences.
🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced aspects of React, Node.js, and exploring the possibilities with AI, particularly with frameworks like OpenAI.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to web development, especially those that make use of JavaScript frameworks like React or Node.js. I'm also interested in AI projects.
